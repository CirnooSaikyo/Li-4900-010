Comparative Study

Similarity:
All three engines have scene hierarchies with parent–child relationships. In all three engines I was able to group objects together and build simple parent–child structures when setting up the level. The basic idea of organizing objects in a hierarchy felt very similar across all three engines.

Difference:
The biggest difference was the asset import workflow. Unity was by far the easiest, I could just copy the Kenney asset files into the Assets folder and everything showed up correctly, which made level building very smooth. Unreal Engine was the most painful. It does not handle importing the whole folders, different model formats caused conflicts, and I had to manually select all FBX files, import textures separately, and then assign materials to models so the models would not appear gray. Godot was much simpler again. After copying the glb asset folder into the project, the models and materials worked right away with no extra setup.

Instancing comparison:
Prefabs, Blueprint Actors, and PackedScenes are basically ways to reuse things without rebuilding them every time. Unity’s Prefabs feel quick and simple, Unreal’s Blueprint Actors feel heavier and more complicated because it is called Blueprint which makes me thinking about coding and all those hard stuff, and Godot’s PackedScenes feel like reusing a whole scene at once because I don't know why they call a object scene.

My pick:
If I had to rebuild the same level again, I would choose Unity because it is easy to use, well organized, and just feels right when building levels. I LOVE UNITY!
